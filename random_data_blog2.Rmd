This post is part II of a series detailing the GitHub package, [**wakefield**](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield), for generating random data sets.  The [First Post (part I)](https://trinkerrstuff.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/random-data-sets-quickly/) was a test run to gauge user interest.  I received positive feedback and some ideas for improvements, which I'll share below.

The post is broken into the following sections:

# Brief Package Description

First we'll use the [**pacman**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html) package to grab the **wakefield** package from GitHub and then load it as well as the handy **dplyr** package. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)
p_load(dplyr, wakefield)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)
p_install_gh("trinker/wakefield")
p_load(dplyr, wakefield)
```

The main function in **wakefield** is  `r_data_frame`.  It takes `n` (the number of rows) and any number of *variable functions* that generate random columns.  The result is a data frame with named, randomly generated columns.  Below is an example, for details see [Part I](https://trinkerrstuff.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/random-data-sets-quickly/) or the [README](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield/blob/master/README.md)

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(n = 30,
    id,
    race,
    age(x = 8:14),
    Gender = sex,
    Time = hour,
    iq,
    grade, 
    height(mean=50, sd = 10),
    died,
    Scoring = rnorm,
    Smoker = valid
)
```

# Improvements 

## Repeated Measures Series     

Big thanks to [Ananda Mahto](https://github.com/mrdwab) for [suggesting](https://github.com/mrdwab) better handing of repeated measures series and provided concise code to extend this capability.

The user may now specify the same *variable function* multiple times and it is named appropriately:

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(
    n = 500,
    id,
    age, age, age,
    grade, grade, grade
)
```


But he went further, recommending a short hand for `variable, variable, variable`.  The `r_series` function takes a variable function and `j` number of columns.  It can also be renamed with the `name` argument:

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(n=100,
    id,
    age,
    sex,
    r_series(gpa, 2),
    r_series(likert, 3, name = "Question")
)
```

## Dummy Coding Expansion of Factors    

It is sometimes nice to expand a factor into j (number of groups) dummy coded columns.  Here we see a factor version and then a dummy coded version of the same data frame:

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(n=100,
    id,
    age,
    sex,
    political
)
```

The dummy coded version...

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(n=100,
    id,
    age,
    r_dummy(sex, prefix = TRUE),
    r_dummy(political)
)
```

## Factor to Numeric Conversion

There are times when you feel like a factor and the when you feel like an integer version.  This is particularly useful with Likert-type data and other ordered factors.  The `as_integer` function takes a `data.frame` and allows the user t specify the indices (`j`) to convert from factor to numeric.  Here I show a factor `data.frame` and then the integer conversion:

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(5,
    id, 
    r_series(likert, j = 4, name = "Item")
)
```

As integers...

```{r}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(5,
    id, 
    r_series(likert, j = 4, name = "Item")
) %>% 
    as_integer(-1)
```

## Viewing Whole Data Set 

**dplyr** has a nice print method that hides excessive rows and columns.  Typically this is great behavior.  Sometimes you want to quickly see the whole width of the data set.  We can use `View` but this is still wide and shows all columns.  The `peek` function shows minimal rows, truncated columns, and prints wide for quick inspection.  This is particularly nice for text strings as data.  **dplyr** prints wide data sets like this:

```{r}
r_data_frame(100,
    id, 
    name,
    sex,
    sentence    
)
```

Now use `peek`:

```{r}
r_data_frame(100,
    id, 
    name,
    sex,
    sentence    
) %>% peek
```

## Visualizing Column Types and NAs   

When we build a large random data set it is nice to get a sense of the column types and the missing values.  The `table_heat` (also `plot` for `tbl_df` class) does this.  Here I'll generate a data set, add missing values (`r_na`), and then plot:

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=11}
set.seed(10)

r_data_frame(n=100,
    id,
    dob,
    animal,
    grade, grade,
    death,
    dummy,
    grade_letter,
    gender,
    paragraph,
    sentence
) %>%
   r_na() %>%
   plot(palette = "Set1")
```


# Table of Variable Functions 

There are currently `r length(variables())` **wakefield** based *variable functions* to chose for building columns. Use `variables()` to see them or `variables(TRUE)` to see a list of them broken into variable types.  Here's an HTML table version:


```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, comment=NA, warning=FALSE, htmlcap="Available Variable Functions"}
p_load(pander, xtable)

switch(out_type,
    html = {variables("matrix", ncol=5) %>%
                xtable() %>%
                print(type = 'html', include.colnames = FALSE, include.rownames = FALSE,
                html.table.attributes = '')
           },
    latex = {variables("matrix", ncol=6) %>%
                xtable() %>%
                print(include.colnames = FALSE, include.rownames = FALSE, table.placement="!h")
            }
)
#matrix(c(sprintf("`%s`", vect), blanks), ncol=4) %>%
#    pandoc.table(format = "markdown", caption = "Available variable functions.")
```

# Possible Uses  

## Testing Methods 

I personally will use this most frequently when I'm testing out a model.  For example say you wanted to test psychometric functions, including the `cor` function, on a randomly generated assessment:

```{r}
dat <- r_data_frame(120,
    id, 
    sex,
    age,
    r_series(likert, 15, name = "Item")
) %>% 
    as_integer(-c(1:3))

dat %>%
    select(contains("Item")) %>%
    cor %>%
    heatmap
```

## Unique Student Data for Course Assignments 

Sometimes it's nice if students each have their own data set to work with but one in which you control the parameters.  Simply supply the students with a unique integer id and they can use this inside of `set.seed` with a **wakefield** `r_data_frame` you've constructed for them in advance.  Viola 25 instant data sets that are structurally the same but randomly different.

```{r eval=FALSE}
student_id <- ## INSERT YOUT ID HERE
    
set.seed(student_id)

dat <- function(1000,
    id, 
    gender,
    religion,
    internet_browser,
    language,
    iq,
    sat,
    smokes
)    
```

## Blogging and Online Help Communities

**wakefield** can make data sharing on blog posts and online hep communities (e.g., [TalkStats](http://www.talkstats.com/), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)) fast, accessible, and with little space or cognitive effort.  Use `variables(TRUE)` to see *variable functions* by class and select the ones you want:

```{r}
variables(TRUE)
```

Then throw the inside of `r_data_fame` to make a quick data set to share.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
r_data_frame(8,
    name,
    sex,
    r_series(iq, 3)
) %>%
    peek %>%
    dput
```
